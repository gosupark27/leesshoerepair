## 🧭 For Future Developers

Welcome. If you’re here, it means you’ve been entrusted to carry on the work — not just technically, but spiritually.

Please:

- Keep the codebase clean and human-readable
- Honor the UI language (serif + clean spacing + minimalist aesthetic)
- Follow mobile-first principles
- Add features **only if they serve the customer** or the legacy of the brand
- Write code as if someone you deeply respect will read it

If you’re adding features, make sure to `npm run dev` locally, test on both mobile & desktop views, and submit PRs with meaningful commit messages.
